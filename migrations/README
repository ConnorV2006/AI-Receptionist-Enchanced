This directory contains Alembic migrations for your Flask application.

Migrations are versioned steps that modify the database schema. They are used
by Flask‑Migrate to evolve your database alongside your models.

To generate a new migration locally use:

```
flask db migrate -m "Describe your change here"
```

Then apply the migration with:

```
flask db upgrade
```

For more information see the Flask‑Migrate documentation.
